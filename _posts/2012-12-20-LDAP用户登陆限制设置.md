LDAP用户登陆限制设置
========================

以下内容摘自[《LDAP System Administration》](http://static.ppurl.com/chmview-V1IBMFB*VCFQNlM4D1MBblFzUjYIYgdqUjUDM1FvA2U=/)
The simplest way would be to create two LDAP groups, e.g. "tester" and "developer", or whatever. Then on linux2, linux3, and linux4, you would add pam_groupdn "developers" to /etc/ldap.conf.
##### 6.7 Authorization Through PAM
Once a user has been authenticated, the account management features of the pam_ldap module provide two means of restricting access to a host, independent of any other PAM modules you may have specified in the configuration file (e.g., the pam_nologin module). Which method you choose depends on whether you wish to bind a host to a group of users or bind a user to a group of hosts.
##### 6.7.1 One Host and a Group of Users
The first authorization method, in which you specify a group of users who are allowed to use a particular host, ties into other information you have already migrated into the directory. The host entry for a machine (generated from /etc/hosts by the PADL migration scripts) can be extended to include a list of DNs for users (member) that are authorized to log on using pam_ldap. The following LDIF example shows how you can use the extensibleObject class to associate a group of users with a host entry:
	dn: cn=pogo,ou=hosts,dc=plainjoe,dc=org
	objectClass: ipHost
	objectClass: device
	objectClass: extensibleObject
	ipHostNumber: 192.168.1.75
	cn: pogo.plainjoe.org
	cn: pogo
	member: uid=gcarter,ou=people,dc=plainjoe,dc=org
	member: uid=kristi,ou=people,dc=plainjoe,dc=org
	member: uid=deryck,ou=people,dc=plainjoe,dc=org

In order to configure pam_ldap to honor this group membership, the following two lines must be added to /etc/ldap.conf:
	## Define the DN of the entry to contain the groupOfUniqueNames.
	pam_groupdn              cn=pogo,ou=hosts,dc=plainjoe,dc=org
      
	## Define the attribute type that should be used in the attempt to match the user's
	## DN.
	pam_member_attribute       member

For OpenSSH, this configuration means that only those users whose DN is listed as one of the values for the member attribute will be allowed ssh access to your host.

##### 6.7.2 One User and a Group of Hosts
You can also specify the machines that any given user is allowed to access. To implement this control mechanism, the structural account object class listed in the cosine.schema file must be present in the list of object classes for an entry. This is done for you by the PADL migration scripts. 
Figure 6-6 shows that the account object class requires only one attribute. This attribute, uid, is already required by the posixAccount object class and is therefore guaranteed to be present.

Figure 6-6. Schema for the account object class
[!Schema for the account object class](http://static.ppurl.com/chmview-V1IBMFB*VCFQNlM4D1MBblFzUjYIYgdqUjUDM1FvA2U=/files/ldap_0606.gif)
While several optional attribute types are available with the addition of this new object class, only the host attribute is of use to pam_ldap. The following LDIF listing shows how the account object class can be used to control access:
	dn: uid=gcarter,ou=People,dc=plainjoe,dc=org
	uid: gcarter
	cn: Gerald (Jerry) Carter
	objectClass: account
	objectClass: posixAccount
	objectClass: shadowAccount
	loginShell: /bin/bash
	uidNumber: 780
	gidNumber: 100
	homeDirectory: /home/queso/gcarter
	userPassword: {crypt}GoYLwzMD6cuZE
	host: queso.plainjoe.org
	host: pogo.plainjoe.org
	host: tumnus.plainjoe.org

This listing shows that the user gcarter is allowed to access the hosts queso, pogo, and tumnus. To enable pam_ldap's host-checking functionality, you must enable the pam_check_host_attr parameter in ldap.conf:
	## Enable host attribute lookups.
	pam_check_host_attr     yes

If the list of hosts does not contain the hostname of the system that the user wants to access, he is denied access. If the host list is empty (i.e., no host attribute is present), the user is denied access by default. 
注: 该种方法只能根据机器的域名来限制用户登陆。

/etc/ldap.conf
check_host_peer 的项 开启为yes
在添加用户时 使用ＨＯＳＴ项，后面跟需要登录的主机ＩＰ

可以尝试以下方法：

其实还可以做更简单的配置，在客户端主机上修改/etc/ldap.conf文件来限定搜索LDAP服务器目录树的范围
	#/etc/ldap.conf
	nss_base_passwd  ou=IT,ou=People,dc=boy,dc=com
	nss_base_shadow  ou=IT,ou=People,dc=boy,dc=com
	nss_base_group    ou=IT,ou=Group,dc=boy,dc=com
